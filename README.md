# Emergency Fire Evacuation System
A Real-time Intelligent Three Dimensional Fire Evacuation Guidance System Based on Sensor Web Service and 3D City Models Open Standards

<h2> Introduction </h2>
As the rapid economic development and urbanization trends have led to the intensive use of land in urban areas. The inner spaces of the buildings are more complex. Moreover, their high capacity and centralized nature increase the complexity of designing efficacious escape and rescue routes. In this situation, fire disaster prevention and management is a critical issue, with serious issues including alarm notification and evacuation route simulation. However, as evacuation route charts are commonly displayed in a two-dimensional format, these charts cannot identify the location of the fire or recommend the ideal evacuation route.
In recent years, applications of the sensor web have been used to improve the capability of environment observation. We can monitor the environment immediately and obtain the dynamical phenomenon by sensor web. For building model, using GeoJSON permits the display of a site in three dimensions, which helps building occupants to visualize and immediately understand the status of a fire or other emergency. By using nodes and edges, JSON forms the network for indoor space navigation in three dimensions.
Effective fire disaster prevention methods integrate sensing technology, analysis, judgment, decision, and action functions. Therefore, the key aspects of this project include (1)  The fire escape perspective, which provides victims with critical and accurate information and identifies the most appropriate routings to accomplish escape; (2) Integration System to integrate and share fire and rescue information using a sensor web integration platform. Achieving these aspects is critical to resolving the current communication problems that are inhibiting effective information transmission between firefighters and persons in danger.

<h2> Objective </h2>
This project will applying GeoJSON and indoor route network with JSON format in a 3D model for the disaster prevention that integrates information on fire-prevention facilities, wireless sensors, evacuation route analysis and disaster-prevention functions. Creating a framework for an intelligent fire and disaster prevention system using the integration GeoJSON and route network works as follows: When the wireless sensors detect sufficiently high temperature or smoke levels, the system works to sounds the alarm, and then monitors the fire-outbreak locations and the evacuation routes, which are calculated by the operations in the integration 3D model. After the event, the system also records the historical data on sensor web database, which helps the review of events for analyzing. The proposed integration system is designed to enhance the timeliness and safety of evacuation actions.

<h2> Expected Contribution </h2>
The victims of fire require real-time, explicit information from the scene of a fire in order to make rapid, correct decisions regarding response and rescue. For instance, the fire scene information on sensor web in the building model may help victims make judgments on the relative relationship of locations among the ignition point, and indoor route network provide the rescue/escape routes after calculation, effectively reducing uncertainty and the disaster response time. The use of this project in fire disaster prevention management focus on providing 3D visual effect and connecting building elements in order to support real-time evacuation information inquiries, simulations and records.
In this system, different device, data model and commination protocol causes the heterogeneity problem. Based on the concept of open standards, this project focus on the interoperability of data integration. In this project, the integration of different domain: sensor web and 3D city model, the interoperability can improve by following the open standards.<br>
