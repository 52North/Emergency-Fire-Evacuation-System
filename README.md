# Emergency Fire Evacuation System

Firefighters and the victims require real-time, explicit information from the scene of a fire in order to make rapid, correct decisions regarding response and rescue. For instance, the fire scene information on sensor web in the CityGML model may help firefighters make judgments on the relative relationship of locations among the ignition point, and IndoorGML provide the rescue/escape routes after calculation, effectively reducing uncertainty and the disaster response time. The use of this project in fire disaster prevention management focus on providing 3D visual effect and connecting building elements in order to support real-time evacuation information inquiries, simulations and records.
In this system, different device, data model and commination protocol causes the heterogeneity problem. Based on the concept of open standards, this project focus on the interoperability of data integration. In this project, the integration of different domain: sensor web and 3D city model, the interoperability can improve by following the open standards.
